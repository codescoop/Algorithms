/* 
    Topic - Book Allocation
    
    You are given number of pages in n different books and m students. The books are arranged in ascending
    order of number of pages. Every student is assigned to read some consecutive books. The task is to 
    assign books in such a way that the maximum number of pages assigned to a student is minimum.

    Input Format: First line contains integer t as number of test cases. 
                  Next t lines contains two lines. For each test case, 
                  1st line contains two integers n and m which represents the number of books and students and 
                  2nd line contains n space separated integers which represents the number of pages of 
                  n books in ascending order.

    Constraints:  1 < t < 50
                  1< n < 100
                  1< m <= 50
                  1 <= Ai <= 1000

    Output Format: Print the maximum number of pages that can be assigned to students.

    Sample Input: 1
                  4 2
                  12 34 67 90

    Sample Output: 113 

    Explanation: 1st students : 12 , 34, 67 (total = 113)
                 2nd students : 90 (total = 90)
                 Print max(113, 90)

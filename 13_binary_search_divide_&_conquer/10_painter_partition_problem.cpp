    Topic - Painter's Partition Problem
    
    You have to paint N boards of length {A0, A1, A2, A3 â€¦ AN-1}. There are K painters available and 
    you are also given how much time a painter takes to paint 1 unit of board. 
    You have to get this job done as soon as possible under the constraints that any painter will 
    only paint contiguous sections of board. Return the ans % 10000003

    Input Format: First line contains three space seperated integers N,K and T ,where
                  T = Time taken to print each board by one painter
                  K = No of painters available ,
                  N = Size of array,
                  Next line contains N space seperated positive integers denoting size of N boards.

    Constraints:  1 <= N,K,T,Li <= 100000

    Output Format: Return minimum time required to paint all boards % 10000003.

    Sample Input: 5 
                  2
                  2
                  1 10

    Sample Output: 50
    
    Explanation: The first painter can paint the first board in 5 units of time and the 
                 second painter will take 50 units of time to paint the second board. 
                 Since both can paint simultaneously , the total time required to paint both 
                 the boards is 50.

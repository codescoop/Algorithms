    TOPIC: Linked List - Insertion-I
           [Insertion at Head of Linked List]

    we can create linked list using:
    - Linked List Class   (Object Oriented Programming)
    - Function            (Procedural Programming)
      (functions to perform different operations in linked list)
      
    Insertion in linked  list can be done at:
    - head
    - middle
    - tail

    Why Dynamic Allocation not Static Allocation in Linked List ?
    - In static allocation, when the function call is over, all the variables that are created statically 
      are destroyed. 
      Thus, the Node which we create inside the function will also get destroyed, when the function call is over.
      Like: insertAtHead(head,3);
            insertAtHead(head,99);
            insertAtHead(head,10);
    - So, to create chain of Nodes, we use dynamic memory allocation.

    cout << "Linked List: ";
    print(head);
    print(head);

    /* When using print() twice, Does data will be printed Twice or just Once ??
       - As, print() function is taking parameter as "call by value". So, it will print data twice
       But
       - if print() function should have using "call by reference", then it will print data only once.
         As, we have changed the original "head pointer" to NULL.

OUTPUT:

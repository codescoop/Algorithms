    TOPIC: Data Structures - Introduction

    Data Structures
    ----------------
    - Array
    - Vector (Dynamic Array)
    - Linked List
    - Stack
    - Queue
    - Trees (Binary Tree & BST)
    - Heaps (Priority Queue)
    - Graphs
    - Hashtables
    - Tries

    Advanced Data Structures [Used in Competitive Programming]
    ------------------------ 
    - Segment Trees
    - Fenwick Tree
    - AVL Tree

    Why do we need Data Structures(DS) ?
    - Every DS has its own uniqueness/speciality because they are the containers that stores data.
    - And depending upon the problem, we perform different operations 
      Like: insertion, deletion, searching, ordering
    - Based on the above operations, each DS has its own Space & Time Complexity.
    Eg: Suppose, there is a problem in which we have to store data in a sorted order.
        Then, we have to make a choice that we should use heap or array ... or may be we should use some
        sorting algorithm later on.
        So, we have to make a tradeoff between Space & Time Complexity and choose the most relevnt DS.

    What we will learn ?
    - Implementaion of each data structure
    - And their STL Implementation

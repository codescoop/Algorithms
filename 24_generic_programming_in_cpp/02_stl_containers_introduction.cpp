/* 
    TOPIC: STL Containers - Introduction

    Containers in STL:-
    - All the containers in STL are divided into 4 major catogries:
      1. Sequence Containers
      2. Container Adoptors
      3. Associative Containers
      4. Unordered Associative Containers


    Sequence Containers: 
    - implement data structure which can be accessed in a sequential manner.
      - array 
      - vector
      - list (Double Linked List)
      - deque
      - forward list (Single Linked List)

    Container Adoptors:
    - provide a different interface for sequential containers.
      - stack
      - queue
      - priority queue

    Associative Containers: 
    - implement sorted data structure that can be quickly searched (O(logn) Complexity).
      - set
      - multiset
      - map
      - multimap
      NOTE: All the above data structures are some kind of binary search tree's like Red-Black Tree,...

    Unordered Associative Containers: 
    - implement unordered data structure that can be quickly searched.
      - unordered set
      - unordered multiset
      - unordered map
      - unordered multimap

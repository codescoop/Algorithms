    Topic: LCM
    
    Take the following as input.
    A number (N1)
    A number (N2)
    Write a function which returns the LCM of N1 and N2. Print the value returned.

    Constraints: 0 < N1 < 1000000000 0 < N2 < 1000000000

    Sample Input:  4 
                   6

    Sample Output: 12

    Explanation:  The smallest number that is divisible by both N1 and N2 is called the LCM of N1 and N2.

    Topic: Prime Factorisation (using optimised trail divisions)

    - Prime Factorisation of a Number
      1. Natve Approach        (check prime for 2 to N)
      2. Optimized Approach    (check prime for 2 to sqrt(N))
      3. Sieve Based Approach  (It is useful when we have many queries & we have to compute prime factors 
                                for every number. So, its better to create a prime sieve that will store
                                all the the primes numbers i.e precompute the prime )

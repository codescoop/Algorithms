    Topic: Unique Numbers - III

    We are given an array containg n numbers. 
    All the numbers are present thrice except for one number which is only present once. 
    Find the unique number. Only use - bitwise operators, and no extra space.

    Input Format:  First line contains the number n. Second line contains n space separated number.

    Constraints:  N < 10^5

    Output Format:  Output a single line containing the unique number

    Sample Input:   7
                    1 1 1 2 2 2 3

    Sample Output:  3

    Explanation:  3 is present only once

        Thus to find the unique number, take modulus with 3 for sum-of-bit-count at every bit position
        (i.e eliminating the contribution of bits which are occuring 3N times) & converting 0s and 1s 
        into decimal number.

OUTPUT:

Case 1:

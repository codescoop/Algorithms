/* 
    Topic - Using new & delete operator

    - new Operator
        > To allocate space dynamically, use the unary operator "new", followed by the type being allocated.
          Eg:   new int;           // dynamically allocates an int
                new double;        // dynamically allocates a double

        > If creating an Array dynamically, use the same form, but put brackets with a size after the type:
          Eg:   new int[40];       // allocates an array of 40 ints
                new double[size];  // allocates an array of [size] doubles
   
    - delete operator
        > To de-allocate memory that was created with 'new', we use the unary operator 'delete'. 
          The one operand should be a pointer that stores the address of the space to be deallocated:
          Eg:   int * ptr = new int;      // dynamically created int
                delete ptr;               // deletes the space that ptr points to

    Topic - Painter Problem

    You have to paint N boards of length {A0, A1, A2, A3 â€¦ AN-1}. 
    There are K painters available and you are also given how much time a painter takes to paint 1 unit 
    of board. You have to get this job done as soon as possible under the constraints that any painter
    will only paint contiguous sections of board. Return the ans % 10000003

    Input Format: First line contains three space seperated integers N,K and T ,where
                  N = Size of array,
                  K = No of painters available ,
                  T = Time taken to print each board by one painter
                  Next line contains N space seperated positive integers denoting size of N boards.

    Constraints: 1<=N<=100000
                 1<=K<=100000
                 1<=T<=1000000
                 1<=Li<=100000

    Output Format: Return minimum time required to paint all boards % 10000003.

    Sample Input: 2 2 5
                  1 10

    Sample Output: 50

    Explanation: The first painter can paint the first board in 5 units of time and 
                 the second painter will take 50 units of time to paint the second board. 
                 Since both can paint simultaneously , the total time required to paint both 
                 the boards is 50.
